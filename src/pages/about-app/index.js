                  course recently and I needed a practical way to repeat the
                  lessons I've learnt. So I've come up with the idea of ToDo
                  List project. I knew that simple ToDo list would not be that
                  interesting but the kanban board would require too much work.
                  Finally I've decided to build ToDo app expanded with several
                  additional functionalities.

                  When using this app you can not only create a simple todo
                  list, but also a much advanced lists which are called
                  <span className="text-highlight"> tasklists</span>. Tasklist
                  contains deadline, tags, operations and description.
                  Operations are kind of subtasks, necessary to complete the
                  main task. Each operation consists of estimated time needed to
                  complete it and description. Tasklists are great tools that
                  will certainly help you with big projects or long-term plans.
                  Whereas, simple todo lists will work perfectly as reminders,
                  quick notes or shopping lists.

                  the checkbox in order to display the list in the pinned lists
                  section. There are two slots for simple lists and one slot for
